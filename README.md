# Github Finder App

This React application utilizes GitHub API to search for users and display user details. The application is built using functional components, React hooks and Context API.

The application is deployed through Netlify and can be viewed [here](https://githubfinder90384750934.netlify.app/).

This app was built as a code-along project for [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-front-to-back/) Udemy course.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

### `yarn test`

### `yarn build`

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
